# Mary Martin
## What is your developer journey so far? What brought you to this major, and why did you take this class?
My developer journey includes my experience as a computer science major, my research experience, and my internship experience. I chose to change my major to computer science in my sophomore year of college when I became interested in programming and mathematics. I chose to take this class to become a more well rounded developer, as most of my experience involves object oriented languages and scripting. 
## What is your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations?
My ideal career progression would include completing a PhD in machine learning and NLP and going on to have a career in academia or research. 

## What programming experience do you have? Do you have any web experience?
I have experience with Java, C++, Python, R, HTML, SQL, CSS, some PHP and JavaScript and other languages as well.
